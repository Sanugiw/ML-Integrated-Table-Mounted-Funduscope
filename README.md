# Table Mounted Funduscope

The Table-Mounted Fundoscope is a stationary retinal imaging device designed to improve diagnostic accuracy and ease of use. Unlike handheld fundoscopy methods, this device eliminates motion artifacts caused by patient or doctor movements, ensuring stable and high-quality retinal imaging.

With WiFi connectivity, the fundoscope enables seamless wireless transmission of retinal images to a computer, facilitating real-time data access and remote analysis. Additionally, the system integrates a machine learning-powered UI, allowing doctors to upload images and receive preliminary disease diagnoses. This assists in early detection and enables further analysis when necessary.

This repository contains the source code, firmware, and relevant documentation for the development, deployment, and enhancement of the Table-Mounted Fundoscope.
